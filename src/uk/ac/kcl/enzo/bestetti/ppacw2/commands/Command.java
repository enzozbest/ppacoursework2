/**
 * This class is part of the "White Souls" application.
 * "White Souls" is a very simple, text based adventure game.
 * <p>
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command consists of two strings: a command word and a second
 * string (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings
 * obviously are "take" and "map").
 * <p>
 * The way this is used is:
 * <p>
 * Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 * <p>
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
 * <p>
