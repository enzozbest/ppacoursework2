 * This class is part of the "White Souls" application.
 * "White Souls" is a very simple text based adventure game.
 * Users can walk around some scenery, interact with items, interact with NPCs, and fight enemies.
 * <p>
 * This class implements the high-level game logic (e.g. processing command requests) and stores some information which can be used by other classes
 * through the RoomHandler, CharacterHandler, Initialiser, and BossHandler objects.
 * <p>
 * This is the Client class of the Command Pattern Design implemented in this project.
